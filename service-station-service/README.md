# Service Location Service

## Demo Initialization

You can do bulk uploads of location data by POSTing to the `/bulk/serviceLocations` endpoint. E.g.

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:9001/bulk/serviceLocations -d @locations.json
```

where `locations.json` is a file containing a JSON array of `ServiceLocation` objects.
There's a small sample for testing in `src/test/resources`. You can also find
a complete set of US locations at
http://assets.springone2gx2015.s3.amazonaws.com/fleet/serviceLocations.json
(available for anonymous download).

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

This app deploys nicely to Cloud Foundry and looks for a config server (via its 
`bootstrap.yml`) via a service called "configserver" with credentials containing a 
URI.
